Every perfect right angled triangle is super-perfect. Since triangle is primitive, let \(a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c^2 = m^2 + n^2\) be lengths of triangle sides, where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime and of distinct parity. We have another pythagorean triple \((m, n, c)\), so \(m = k(s^2 - t^2)\) and \(n = 2kst\). We want to prove that \(3 \cdot 4 \cdot 7 = 84 \mid \frac{ab}{2} = (m^2 - n^2)mn = k^4(s^2 - t^2 - 2st)(s^2 - t^2 + 2st)(s - t)(s + t)2st\), where \(s\) and \(t\) are coprime and of distinct parity. We have 3 subtasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(3 \mid (s^2 - t^2 - 2st)(s^2 - t^2 + 2st)(s - t)(s + t)2st\)

Suppose that neither \(s\) nor \(t\) are divisible by 3. Then either \(s \equiv t\) mod 3 and \(3 \mid s - t\) or one is equal to 1 modulo 3 and other one is equal to 2 modulo 3, so \(3 \mid s + t\).
\item \(4 \mid (s^2 - t^2 - 2st)(s^2 - t^2 + 2st)(s - t)(s + t)2st\)

Obvious, since either \(s\) or \(t\) is even, so \(4 \mid 2st\).
\item \(7 \mid (s^2 - t^2 - 2st)(s^2 - t^2 + 2st)(s - t)(s + t)2st\)

All 49 cases (including the impossible one \((0, 0)\)) for remainders of \(x\) and \(y\) are checked by code.
\end{itemize}
