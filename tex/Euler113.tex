\begin{enumerate}
\item Number of non-decreasing sequences with elements from set
\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\) with length \(k\) is \(\binom{k + 8}{k}\)
(\textit{stars and bars} argument).
\item Number of non-decreasing numbers of length \(\leq 100\) is
\(\sum_{k = 1}^{100} \binom{8 + k}{k} = \binom{8 + 100 + 1}{100} - 1
= 4263421511270\)
\item Number of non-increasing sequences with elements from set
\(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\) with length \(k\) is \(\binom{k + 9}{k}\)
(\textit{stars and bars} argument).
\item Number of non-decreasing numbers of length \(\leq 100\) is
\(\sum_{k = 1}^{100} \binom{9 + k}{k} = \binom{9 + 100 + 1}{100} - 1
= 46897636623980\)
\item From this we have to count out constant sequences
(we don't want to count sequences 00\dots00 and other constant sequences
were counted twice).

There are \(\sum_{i = 1}^{100} 10 = 1000\) constant sequences.
\item Final answer is \(4263421511270 + 46897636623980 - 1000 = 51161058134250\).
